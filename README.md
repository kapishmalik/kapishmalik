### 🚀 About Me

I'm a hands-on backend engineer passionate about building scalable distributed systems and driving platform modernization. I specialize in microservices architecture, robust API design, and leading teams to deliver high-impact, resilient backend solutions. My open source work focuses on developer tooling for API simulation, testing, and cloud-native workflows.

### 👨‍💻 Professional Journey

After completing my M.Tech in Computer Science from IIIT Delhi, I began my career engineering payment and compliance microservices at Directi (now Newfold Digital). Over the years, I took on increasingly complex challenges, progressing from Software Engineer to Principal Backend Engineer.

- **Early Career:** Built and integrated payment gateways and compliance microservices, ensuring platform PCI and international regulatory compliance.
- **Platform Modernization:** Led the migration of the OrderBox monolith (serving 5M+ customers) to a microservices-based registrar platform using Spring Boot, dramatically improving scalability and maintainability.
- **Technical Leadership:** Drove multi-million dollar revenue projects, such as enabling .COM resale with Verisign NUP and integrating SnapNames auctions, and delivered ICANN RDP compliance for 300+ TLDs.
- **Mentorship:** Grew and mentored engineering teams, championing best practices for API development, cloud security, and test automation.
- **Open Source Impact:** Became a major contributor to Hoverfly and WireMock, and created Hoverfly MCP Server — a modern API mocking solution adopted in AI development tools.
